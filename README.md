On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially classified COVID-19 as a pandemic. At the time, the number of confirmed cases were over 130,000 across 114 countries around the world, with the number of deaths caused by the disease over 5,000.

COVID-19 is the acronym of "coronavirus disease 2019" and is the disease caused by a new strain of coronavirus which first appeared in late 2019. According to the WHO, viral diseases like COVID-19 continue to emerge and represent a serious public health risk worldwide. In recent years we have seen the emergence of epidemics such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 and H1N1 influenza in 2009.

Accurately modelling the spread of these viral diseases is critical for policymakers and health workers to take appropriate actions to contain and mitigate the impact of these disease.

This challenge asks data scientists on Zindi to accurately predict the spread of COVID-19 around the world over the next few months. Solutions will be evaluated against future data.

The effects of COVID-19 have yet to emerge as the situation is evolving rapidly. With this challenge we hope to contribute to the global body of knowledge which will help stem the impact of pandemics such as this one as well as those in the future.
